This week we implemented two important **creational design patterns** in Java:

- ✅ Singleton Pattern
- ✅ Factory Method Pattern


## 🧠 Exercise 1: Singleton Pattern

What We Did
We created a Logger class that ensures only one instance can ever exist in the entire program.

### 📌 What We Learned:
- Singleton ensures only one instance of a class is created.
- Useful for logging, configuration, or database connections.
- Requires:
  - Private constructor
  - Static instance variable
  - Static getter method

### ▶️ How to Run:

javac Logger.java
javac Testclass.java
java Testclass

###🧪 Output:

Logger instance created.  
Same instance? true  
[LOG] Test message 1
[LOg] Test message 2

###🧠 Exercise 2: Factory Method Pattern
📌 What We Learned:
Factory Method lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

We created a base interface Document and concrete types like:

WordDocument

PdfDocument

ExcelDocument

Factory classes were used to create these document objects.

###▶️ How to Run:

javac main/*.java
java -cp . main.Test

###🧪 Output:
Opening a Word document.
Opening a PDF document.
Opening an Excel document.
